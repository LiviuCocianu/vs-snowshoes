**Heads-up**: *For worlds that actively used this mod in versions 1.x: your old snowshoes should be automatically converted to the new variant the moment you interact with them in your inventory or throw them on the ground!*

Do you want to explore during winter, but the snow is so thick that you can barely move whilst losing more hunger? This mod adds snowshoes, for walking over snow layers and negating the walking speed debuff. These bad boys have been invented around 4000 to 6000 years ago (if Wikipedia is to be believed lol) and their ingenious large footprint design allowed humans to spread their weight and walk over snow instead of through it.

Many types of snowshoes can be crafted, depending on what stage of gameplay you are at: early, mid or late game:
1. Crude snowshoes: The easiest to craft, but the least durable
2. Wooden/Carved snowshoes: Decent durability, which can be slightly increased by waxing
    1. Treated snowshoes: Just apply some beeswax on them (also called "uncured wooden snowshoes" after beeswax is applied) and let them dry on a tool rack. This will also give them a nice shine!
3. Metal snowshoes: The most durable type. Require a pair of snowshoe frames to be smithed **(require "[Aluminum from bauxite](https://mods.vintagestory.at/bauxitealuminum)" mod)**
    1. Sturdy metal shoes: Metal snowshoes crafted with sturdy leather instead of plain leather, for an extra durability boost

*The only benefit you get from each tier of snowshoes is more durability!*

Other features:
- Snowshoe durability depletes as you walk with them. *Durability will deplete faster if you don't walk on snow!*
- Combine snowshoes with many types of fur boots in the crafting grid to gain warmth *(Cannot be combined with crude snowshoes!)*:
    - Knee-high fur boots (+2°C)
    - Brown nadiyan fur-lined boots (+2°C)
    - Blue nadiyan fur-lined boots (+2°C)
    - Fur-lined reindeer herder boots (+4°C)
- Clothing condition for fur snowshoes can be restored by clicking with a sewing kit on them in the inventory. No class trait required!
- Durability can be replenished with material in the crafting grid
    - Snowshoe tiers and their materials:
        - Crude snowshoes -> rope
        - Wooden snowshoes -> twine
        - Metal snowshoes -> plain leather/sturdy leather
    - Optionally, you can disable unlimited repairing and impose a limit depending on their grade (wooden or metal) from the config file. By default, players can keep repairing snowshoes forever
- As an admin, you are able to configure all the internal variables of the mod to be in line with your server's rules: durability settings, snow layer checks, snowshoe repair settings ([see variables here](https://github.com/LiviuCocianu/vs-snowshoes/blob/master/Snowshoes/src/config/SnowshoesConfig.cs))
- Store your snowshoes on the ground, tool racks (fur snowshoes are too large for the tool rack), and even shoe racks or wardrobes if you have "[Purposeful Storage](https://mods.vintagestory.at/purposefulstorage)" installed
- Craft wooden snowshoes out of any wood type of your liking for that added cosmetic look ✨
- Take fur snowshoes apart or combine them together at any time in the crafting grid
- Revisit the features of this mod in-game, in an easier to digest way, through the handbook "Snow traversal" guide
